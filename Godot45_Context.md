# Class: TileMapLayer

## Description
Node for 2D tile-based maps. A [TileMapLayer] uses a [TileSet] which contain a list of tiles which are used to create grid-based maps. Unlike the [TileMap] node, which is deprecated, [TileMapLayer] has only one layer of tiles. You can use several [TileMapLayer] to achieve the same result as a [TileMap] node.
		For performance reasons, all TileMap updates are batched at the end of a frame. Notably, this means that scene tiles from a [TileSetScenesCollectionSource] are initialized after their parent. This is only queued when inside the scene tree.
		To force an update earlier on, call [method update_internals].
		[b]Note:[/b] For performance and compatibility reasons, the coordinates serialized by [TileMapLayer] are limited to 16-bit signed integers, i.e. the range for X and Y coordinates is from [code]-32768[/code] to [code]32767[/code]. When saving tile data, tiles outside this range are wrapped.

## Properties
- `collision_enabled` (bool): Enable or disable collisions.
- `collision_visibility_mode` (int): Show or hide the [TileMapLayer]'s collision shapes. If set to [constant DEBUG_VISIBILITY_MODE_DEFAULT], this depends on the show collision debug settings.
- `enabled` (bool): If [code]false[/code], disables this [TileMapLayer] completely (rendering, collision, navigation, scene tiles, etc.)
- `navigation_enabled` (bool): If [code]true[/code], navigation regions are enabled.
- `navigation_visibility_mode` (int): Show or hide the [TileMapLayer]'s navigation meshes. If set to [constant DEBUG_VISIBILITY_MODE_DEFAULT], this depends on the show navigation debug settings.
- `occlusion_enabled` (bool): Enable or disable light occlusion.
- `physics_quadrant_size` (int): The [TileMapLayer]'s physics quadrant size. Within a physics quadrant, cells with similar physics properties are grouped together and their collision shapes get merged. [member physics_quadrant_size] defines the length of a square's side, in the map's coordinate system, that forms the quadrant. Thus, the default quadrant size groups together [code]16 * 16 = 256[/code] tiles.
			[b]Note:[/b] As quadrants are created according to the map's coordinate system, the quadrant's "square shape" might not look like square in the [TileMapLayer]'s local coordinate system.
			[b]Note:[/b] This impacts the value returned by [method get_coords_for_body_rid].
- `rendering_quadrant_size` (int): The [TileMapLayer]'s rendering quadrant size. A quadrant is a group of tiles to be drawn together on a single canvas item, for optimization purposes. [member rendering_quadrant_size] defines the length of a square's side, in the map's coordinate system, that forms the quadrant. Thus, the default quadrant size groups together [code]16 * 16 = 256[/code] tiles.
			The quadrant size does not apply on a Y-sorted [TileMapLayer], as tiles are grouped by Y position instead in that case.
			[b]Note:[/b] As quadrants are created according to the map's coordinate system, the quadrant's "square shape" might not look like square in the [TileMapLayer]'s local coordinate system.
- `tile_map_data` (PackedByteArray): The raw tile map data as a byte array.
- `tile_set` (TileSet): The [TileSet] used by this layer. The textures, collisions, and additional behavior of all available tiles are stored here.
- `use_kinematic_bodies` (bool): If [code]true[/code], this [TileMapLayer] collision shapes will be instantiated as kinematic bodies. This can be needed for moving [TileMapLayer] nodes (i.e. moving platforms).
- `x_draw_order_reversed` (bool): If [member CanvasItem.y_sort_enabled] is enabled, setting this to [code]true[/code] will reverse the order the tiles are drawn on the X-axis.
- `y_sort_origin` (int): This Y-sort origin value is added to each tile's Y-sort origin value. This allows, for example, to fake a different height level. This can be useful for top-down view games.

# Class: NavigationServer2D

## Description
NavigationServer2D is the server that handles navigation maps, regions and agents. It does not handle A* navigation from [AStar2D] or [AStarGrid2D].
		Maps are divided into regions, which are composed of navigation polygons. Together, they define the traversable areas in the 2D world.
		[b]Note:[/b] Most [NavigationServer2D] changes take effect after the next physics frame and not immediately. This includes all changes made to maps, regions or agents by navigation-related nodes in the scene tree or made through scripts.
		For two regions to be connected to each other, they must share a similar edge. An edge is considered connected to another if both of its two vertices are at a distance less than [code]edge_connection_margin[/code] to the respective other edge's vertex.
		You may assign navigation layers to regions with [method NavigationServer2D.region_set_navigation_layers], which then can be checked upon when requesting a path with [method NavigationServer2D.map_get_path]. This can be used to allow or deny certain areas for some objects.
		To use the collision avoidance system, you may use agents. You can set an agent's target velocity, then the servers will emit a callback with a modified velocity.
		[b]Note:[/b] The collision avoidance system ignores regions. Using the modified velocity directly may move an agent outside of the traversable area. This is a limitation of the collision avoidance system, any more complex situation may require the use of the physics engine.
		This server keeps tracks of any call and executes them during the sync phase. This means that you can request any change to the map, using any thread, without worrying.

# Class: TileSet

## Description
A TileSet is a library of tiles for a [TileMapLayer]. A TileSet handles a list of [TileSetSource], each of them storing a set of tiles.
		Tiles can either be from a [TileSetAtlasSource], which renders tiles out of a texture with support for physics, navigation, etc., or from a [TileSetScenesCollectionSource], which exposes scene-based tiles.
		Tiles are referenced by using three IDs: their source ID, their atlas coordinates ID, and their alternative tile ID.
		A TileSet can be configured so that its tiles expose more or fewer properties. To do so, the TileSet resources use property layers, which you can add or remove depending on your needs.
		For example, adding a physics layer allows giving collision shapes to your tiles. Each layer has dedicated properties (physics layer and mask), so you may add several TileSet physics layers for each type of collision you need.
		See the functions to add new layers for more information.

## Properties
- `tile_layout` (int): For all half-offset shapes (Isometric, Hexagonal and Half-Offset square), changes the way tiles are indexed in the [TileMapLayer] grid.
- `tile_offset_axis` (int): For all half-offset shapes (Isometric, Hexagonal and Half-Offset square), determines the offset axis.
- `tile_shape` (int): The tile shape.
- `tile_size` (Vector2i): The tile size, in pixels. For all tile shapes, this size corresponds to the encompassing rectangle of the tile shape. This is thus the minimal cell size required in an atlas.
- `uv_clipping` (bool): Enables/Disable uv clipping when rendering the tiles.

# Class: PhysicsServer2D

## Description
PhysicsServer2D is the server responsible for all 2D physics. It can directly create and manipulate all physics objects:
		- A [i]space[/i] is a self-contained world for a physics simulation. It contains bodies, areas, and joints. Its state can be queried for collision and intersection information, and several parameters of the simulation can be modified.
		- A [i]shape[/i] is a geometric shape such as a circle, a rectangle, a capsule, or a polygon. It can be used for collision detection by adding it to a body/area, possibly with an extra transformation relative to the body/area's origin. Bodies/areas can have multiple (transformed) shapes added to them, and a single shape can be added to bodies/areas multiple times with different local transformations.
		- A [i]body[/i] is a physical object which can be in static, kinematic, or rigid mode. Its state (such as position and velocity) can be queried and updated. A force integration callback can be set to customize the body's physics.
		- An [i]area[/i] is a region in space which can be used to detect bodies and areas entering and exiting it. A body monitoring callback can be set to report entering/exiting body shapes, and similarly an area monitoring callback can be set. Gravity and damping can be overridden within the area by setting area parameters.
		- A [i]joint[/i] is a constraint, either between two bodies or on one body relative to a point. Parameters such as the joint bias and the rest length of a spring joint can be adjusted.
		Physics objects in [PhysicsServer2D] may be created and manipulated independently; they do not have to be tied to nodes in the scene tree.
		[b]Note:[/b] All the 2D physics nodes use the physics server internally. Adding a physics node to the scene tree will cause a corresponding physics object to be created in the physics server. A rigid body node registers a callback that updates the node's transform with the transform of the respective body object in the physics server (every physics update). An area node registers a callback to inform the area node about overlaps with the respective area object in the physics server. The raycast node queries the direct state of the relevant space in the physics server.

# Class: Object

## Description
An advanced [Variant] type. All classes in the engine inherit from Object. Each class may define new properties, methods or signals, which are available to all inheriting classes. For example, a [Sprite2D] instance is able to call [method Node.add_child] because it inherits from [Node].
		You can create new instances, using [code]Object.new()[/code] in GDScript, or [code]new GodotObject[/code] in C#.
		To delete an Object instance, call [method free]. This is necessary for most classes inheriting Object, because they do not manage memory on their own, and will otherwise cause memory leaks when no longer in use. There are a few classes that perform memory management. For example, [RefCounted] (and by extension [Resource]) deletes itself when no longer referenced, and [Node] deletes its children when freed.
		Objects can have a [Script] attached to them. Once the [Script] is instantiated, it effectively acts as an extension to the base class, allowing it to define and inherit new properties, methods and signals.
		Inside a [Script], [method _get_property_list] may be overridden to customize properties in several ways. This allows them to be available to the editor, display as lists of options, sub-divide into groups, save on disk, etc. Scripting languages offer easier ways to customize properties, such as with the [annotation @GDScript.@export] annotation.
		Godot is very dynamic. An object's script, and therefore its properties, methods and signals, can be changed at run-time. Because of this, there can be occasions where, for example, a property required by a method may not exist. To prevent run-time errors, see methods such as [method set], [method get], [method call], [method has_method], [method has_signal], etc. Note that these methods are [b]much[/b] slower than direct references.
		In GDScript, you can also check if a given property, method, or signal name exists in an object with the [code]in[/code] operator:
		[codeblock]
		var node = Node.new()
		print("name" in node)         # Prints true
		print("get_parent" in node)   # Prints true
		print("tree_entered" in node) # Prints true
		print("unknown" in node)      # Prints false
		[/codeblock]
		Notifications are [int] constants commonly sent and received by objects. For example, on every rendered frame, the [SceneTree] notifies nodes inside the tree with a [constant Node.NOTIFICATION_PROCESS]. The nodes receive it and may call [method Node._process] to update. To make use of notifications, see [method notification] and [method _notification].
		Lastly, every object can also contain metadata (data about data). [method set_meta] can be useful to store information that the object itself does not depend on. To keep your code clean, making excessive use of metadata is discouraged.
		[b]Note:[/b] Unlike references to a [RefCounted], references to an object stored in a variable can become invalid without being set to [code]null[/code]. To check if an object has been deleted, do [i]not[/i] compare it against [code]null[/code]. Instead, use [method @GlobalScope.is_instance_valid]. It's also recommended to inherit from [RefCounted] for classes storing data instead of [Object].
		[b]Note:[/b] The [code]script[/code] is not exposed like most properties. To set or get an object's [Script] in code, use [method set_script] and [method get_script], respectively.
		[b]Note:[/b] In a boolean context, an [Object] will evaluate to [code]false[/code] if it is equal to [code]null[/code] or it has been freed. Otherwise, an [Object] will always evaluate to [code]true[/code]. See also [method @GlobalScope.is_instance_valid].

# Class: ResourceLoader

## Description
A singleton used to load resource files from the filesystem.
		It uses the many [ResourceFormatLoader] classes registered in the engine (either built-in or from a plugin) to load files into memory and convert them to a format that can be used by the engine.
		[b]Note:[/b] You have to import the files into the engine first to load them using [method load]. If you want to load [Image]s at run-time, you may use [method Image.load]. If you want to import audio files, you can use the snippet described in [member AudioStreamMP3.data].
		[b]Note:[/b] Non-resource files such as plain text files cannot be read using [ResourceLoader]. Use [FileAccess] for those files instead, and be aware that non-resource files are not exported by default (see notes in the [FileAccess] class description for instructions on exporting them).
