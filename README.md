Mutant Reign is a sci-fi strategy-FPS hybrid. Lead a mobile faction across a ruined supercontinent using a top-down 2D overworld for travel, logistics, and diplomacy, then drop into first-person battles with 20v20 squads. Manage an upgradable DNA-locked bus, secure supply lines, capture and defend strongholds, and survive a hostile mutant ecology. The MVP targets a tight, replayable loop with disciplined assets, strict performance budgets, and a scope-locked battle vertical slice.
